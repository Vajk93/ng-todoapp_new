# ng-todoapp_new


This is a new FrontentMentor challenge, what i did earlier, (2-3- year ago) in vanilla js, vanilla css.

Now, i want to create a new one. With more hands on experience. 

I will use Angular, Tailwind, and IndexDB. (i have never use indexDb, so i will learn something new)

Let's start the work.
